# EMPHACK Client
## Getting the Client to work.

Please install the 1.12.2 Optifine source from [here](https://optifinesource.co.uk/) into the src/minecraft folder in the decompiled MC, accepting the replacements. After that is done you need to
copy and replace the cloned Client folder into the Client folder in the eclipse folder in MCP.
